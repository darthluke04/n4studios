		<h6 style="text-align: center;">My opinion on the Growth of AI and Inventions</h6><br>

		<p>Artificial Inteligence (AI) is growing fast and it is not going to stop growing until it doesnt have anywhere to go. In some cases thats good, because we get new ways to do things and new inventions. But in some ways that is bad because if we invent things without thinking about the possibility of the invention getting into the wrong hands things eventualy will get out of hand.</p>
		<p>History and movies show what happens. "Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning (2023)"Z, "I, Robot (2004)", "Happy Death Day 2U (2019)", "The Terminator (1984)", "War Games (1983)", "WALL-E (2008)". I could go on.</p>
		<p>We need to take action to make AI not able to be hacked to do things to harm people. A program is only harmful if we program it to be harmful, That is why its called program. AI will not harm anyone unless if we program it to.</p>
		<p>If we make the AI more secure so that it cannot be controlled, it WILL get out of hand. Now I know nothing is fully secure but just because nothing is fully secure, that does not mean we should just ignore the fact that we should still try.</p>
		<p>Sorry to rant but I needed to say that.</p>
