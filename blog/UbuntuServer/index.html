		<p>My father's work was selling PCs for $10.00 because they moved everyone to laptops. So my father bought me one. I
			got this computer and I was already wanting to setup a server so I decided to take initiative.</p>

							<p>I got the computer (Dell Optiplex 3020 w/ Solid State Drive). I didn't know what to do so I plugged it
								in and powered it on. I went straight to the bios and to my suprise the bios was locked with an admin
								password. This meant that if I wanted to change any of the settings I would have to enter the admin
								password.<br>This is a problem because, if I add an operating system and use it. And If I need to change
								the bios settings I would not be able to because it has a password. Therefore I would have to reset the
								computer and loose all my data. </p>

							<p>I did some research on resetting the bios password and found that I can take out the CMOS battery. So I
								opened the computer and found the battery. The battery was in a tough spot so instead of taking the
								battery out I took a skewer and pushed it down out of the connection for 5 minutes to reset
								it.<br>Pushing down the battery did not work. I then took the computer back to my fathers company to see
								if they have the password.</p>

							<p>I looked at the Bios again and figured out that they did not change the password for the bios, they just added Windows 10. But I'm just going to live with the bios being partially locked.</p>
