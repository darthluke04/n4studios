		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Blender Best of Pack TV</h2>

		<p>While I was creating a final intro for Pack TV 2022 - 2023, my classmate was creating a video of all the best
			videos / segments in Pack TV 2022 - 2023. So I thought that we could join the videos. He accepted this challenge,
			and so we went to work.</p>

							<p>Ben started to gather the videos and compile them into one video using Adobe Premier Pro. The more
								videos, the better. But it takes time to search, download, and edit clips.</p>

							<p>I started designing the intro. It does not look the best because I was not tracing the logo. I thought
								to either start zoomed into one video and zoom out to all of the videos shaped like the Pack TV logo, or
								start zoomed out and videos fall into place passing the camera making the shape of the Pack TV logo.</p>

							<p>I got the title sequence done and Ben got a few videos compiled so I could start the graphic. But the
								problem is, its a lot of manual work and I wanted to see if Adobe Premier Pro would automate it better.
								But I soon relized that there is no program that can do this. So I started working on it on Blender
								because I am more fluent with blender. I also used blender so I could use the 3D axis.</p>

							<b>05/08/23</b><br>
							<p>I finished a few of the videos so I could get a prototype done. So far it looked pretty promising, but
								it took a lot of manual editing. For example, I had one big video and I had to split them into many
								videos. So I changed the time the video was shown on each tile, which was a pain staking process. On top
								of that, Blender did not act very well with many videos in one scene.</p>

							<p>I helped Ben compile and edit more videos so that it would get done faster because our deadline was in
								4 days. I added more videos to blender and completed the more and more of the logo. I then started
								adding everyone's names into the end of the video. But I knew that the video not even close to being
								finished. Because we still needed to render it and add sound / music.</p>

							<p>This was the last home stretch, we had to finish it before the broadcast. I rendered the video at home
								and brought it to school. Ben added the render graphic to the video and fixed up the sound and finished
								it.<br>We were finally done, we went live and broadcasted the video.<br> After the broadcast we realized
								that Joshua Teles, one of my classmates, was not included in the names. so I told him that I would <a
